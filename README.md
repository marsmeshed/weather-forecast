# weather-forecast


## Description
 The motivation behind this project was to not only assist myself and others who are in need of a the weather, but to display my skills in JS.
 I built this project mainly to showcase my programming using Javascript. This short program will solve issues regarding certain weather situations. You'll never need to sit and ponder what certain weather is like in your desired locations, it's now easier than ever. I learned many elements of JS throughout this project including: null and its cause.

## Usage
Here's a screenshot showing a mockup of what should appear when loading up the program.
